# SchoolDB-UI
I've created my connection class. It's pretty weak now. I should make it more reliable and more secure. But still it works fine now. Next step will be creating a GUI.

Now it's not only a class, but it has a working GUI. All features are not implemented yet. It has a really basic search function. It takes keyword and searchs for it using at as a substring.

I'll create a profile page for students and instructors. Also courses and departments will have their own profile page. That's all for now. 

I have a error checking system in my connection class, but I didn't defined all errors. That's all for now. 

There's an example database included to project without any data included in it. You can import it to your project server by; 
"mysql -u username -p dbname < filename.db"
